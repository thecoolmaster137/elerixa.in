      <h2>APFC Panel (Automatic Power Factor Correction Panel)</h2>
      <p>An APFC (Automatic Power Factor Correction) panel is an electrical control panel used to monitor and improve the power factor of electrical loads.</p>
      <p>The power factor is a measure of how effectively electrical power is utilized by a system. It represents the ratio of real power (kW) to apparent power (kVA) in an AC electrical system.</p>
      <p>The APFC panel consists of power factor correction capacitors that are switched in or out based on the load requirements to maintain a desired power factor.</p>
      <p>It helps in optimizing power consumption, reducing electricity bills, and improving the overall efficiency of the electrical system.</p>
      <p>The APFC panel continuously monitors the power factor and automatically controls the capacitors to maintain a near unity power factor.</p>

      <h2>MCC (Motor Control Center) and PCC (Power Control Center) Panels</h2>
      <p>MCC (Motor Control Center) and PCC (Power Control Center) panels are electrical control panels used for motor control and power distribution, respectively</p>
      <p>MCC panels are used to control and monitor electric motors in industrial processes. They contain motor starters, contactors, overload relays, and other protective devices for motor control and protection.</p>
      <p>PCC panels are used to distribute and control power in large-scale industrial facilities. They receive power from the main power source and distribute it to various loads through circuit breakers, switchgear, and protective devices.</p>

      <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), HMI (Human-Machine Interface) Control Panel</h2>
      <p>PLC, SCADA, and HMI control panels are used in industrial automation systems to monitor and control processes.</p>
      <p>PLC is a digital computer-based control system that uses programmable memory to store instructions and perform control functions. It is used for automating industrial processes, such as assembly lines, machinery control, and manufacturing systems.</p>
      <p>SCADA is a system that collects and analyzes real-time data from various sensors and devices. It provides control and monitoring capabilities for large-scale processes or distributed systems.</p>
      <p>HMI refers to the graphical user interface through which an operator interacts with the automation system. It allows users to monitor process variables, control devices, and receive alarms or notifications.</p>

      <h2>Drive Panels</h2>
      <p>Drive panels, also known as Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) panels or Inverter panels, are used to control the speed and torque of electric motors.</p>
      <p>Drive panels consist of VFDs, which convert the incoming AC power into variable frequency and voltage output to control the speed and direction of motors.</p>
      <p>These panels find applications in various industries, including HVAC systems, pumps, fans, conveyor belts, and other motor-driven equipment.</p>
      <p>They offer energy savings, precise control, and motor protection features such as overload protection, phase loss protection, and over/under voltage protection.</p>

      <h2>AHF Panel (Active Harmonic Filter Panel)</h2>
      <p>An AHF (Active Harmonic Filter) panel is used to mitigate harmonics in electrical systems caused by nonlinear loads.</p>
      <p>Harmonics are undesirable distortions in the electrical waveform that can cause equipment malfunction, overheating, and power quality issues.</p>
      <p>The AHF panel actively monitors the harmonic currents and generates equal and opposite currents to cancel out the harmonics, thus reducing their impact on the system.</p>
      <p>It helps in complying with power quality standards, minimizing voltage distortion, and improving the efficiency of the electrical system.</p>

      <h2>Distribution Panel</h2>
      <p>A distribution panel, also known as a distribution board or breaker panel, is an electrical panel that receives power from the main supply and distributes it to various sub-circuits or loads within a building or facility.</p>
      <p>Distribution panels contain circuit break</p>
